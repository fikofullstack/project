            <p>The most important moment of your life is now. The most important person in your life is the one you are
                with now, and the most important activity in your life is the one you are involved with now. If the
                facts don't fit the theory, change the facts. Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without. The
                smaller your reality, the more convinced you are that you know everything.

                You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger. The past has no power over
                the present moment.

                You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger. This, too, will pass. This,
                too, will pass. The smaller your reality, the more convinced you are that you know everything. Peace
                comes from within. Do not seek it without.</p>
